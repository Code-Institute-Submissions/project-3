            <h3>About</h3>

            <p>This is the milestone project for the “Practical Python” stream, part of the New LMS in the “Full Stack Web Development Course” offered by Code Institute.</p>
            <p>This is a guessing game, which will be part of my portfolio.</p>
            <p></p>

            <h3>Credits</h3>
            <p>I am very grateful to <strong>Marcus Connor</strong> of <a href="http://www.brainlesstales.com" target="_blank"><strong>Brainless Tales</strong></a>
            for the permission to use his images for this game. <br>
            One can read more about Marcus' work in the <a href="http://www.brainlesstales.com" target="_blank"><strong>About page of his website</strong></a>.

            <h3>Playing the Game - Instructions</h3>

            <p>After logging in or registering you are taken to the user page. If you have navigated elsewhere you need to return to the user page. (Note the user page is not available in the navigation if you are not logged in.)</p>
            <p>From the User page you can start a new game. Press the <strong>Play a game</strong> button.</p>
            <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/static/img/playGameBtn.png" alt="play game button image"></img>

            

            <p>An image is shown and your task is to guess the word or phrase. Type this in the space provided. Then click the <strong>Submit Answer</strong> button. If your guess is correct you will earn 10 points and will be moved to the next riddle.</p>
            <p>If you have no clue of the answer, you can click on the <strong>Pass</strong> button.</p>
            <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/static/img/SubmitPassButtons.png" alt="submit and pass buttons image"></img>
            <p>Clicking the pass button, or if your first attempt was wrong will take you to the second attempt page.</p>
            <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/static/img/secondAttempt.png" alt="second attempt"></img>
            <p>Here you can see your previous answers for this riddle, and an indication of the number of words expected. Notice that the number of points for a successful guess has been reduced to 6. As previously you can attempt a reply or pass.</p>
            <p>Please note: the game has been coded in a way that it will accept the answer typed in a single input field. This has been done to facilitate typing.</p>
            <p>If the answer is correct you will earn 6 points and the next riddle is presented. If your guess is wrong or you pass, you will be taken to the page for a third attempt.</p>
            <img class="img-responsive center-block" src="/static/img/thirdAttempt.png" alt="third attempt"></img>
            <p>This time round, apart from the number of words, you will be told how many letters are in each word. This is done at the expense of reduced number of points which, in case of a successful guess are reduced to 2 points.</p>
            <p>If your guess is wrong or you pass, you will be taken to the next riddle. If it happens to be the last riddle in a game, then the game will be over and you will be taken to your User page. The points gained will be added to your scores and if you were good enough you might even make it to the Hall of Fame.</p>

            <p>Each game has 10 riddles with a maximum of 100 points.</p>

            <p><strong>Play, have fun and good luck.</strong></p>
