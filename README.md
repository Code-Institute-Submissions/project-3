# Riddle-Me-This Game


## Overview
### What is this website for?
This project will form part of my submission for the Fullstack Web Developer course that I am doing at Code Institute.

This will be my milestone project for Practical Python module of the new LMS.

This the the [github repository](https://github.com/abonello/project-3),
and this project is deployed as a github page [here](https://abonello.github.io/project-1/). UPDATE

I am basing this project on an earlier exploratory exercise that I did. This previous exercise was meant to be a draft to practice the techniques and skills I need for this project. It can be found [here](https://github.com/abonello/riddle-game-app).
Another project that I built to learn the techniques I need is an addition game. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/abonello/addition_game).

The main change I did from my earlier riddle game project is to base the current one on OOP. In this way I can have multiple users logged in without interfering with each other. This is what I learnt from the addition game.
