## Overview
### What is this website for?
This project will form part of my submission for the Fullstack Web Developer course that I am doing at Code Institute.

This will be my milestone project for Practical Python module of the new LMS.

This the the [github repository](https://github.com/abonello/project-1),  UPDATE
and this project is deployed as a github page [here](https://abonello.github.io/project-1/). UPDATE

I am basing this project on an earlier exploratory exercise that I did. This previous exercise was meant to be a draft to practice the techniques and skills I need for this project. It can be found [here] UPDATE(https://github.com/abonello/JumbotronExperiment).

Add INFO ABOUT ADDITION GAME.

The main change I did from my earlier project is to base the current one on OOP. In this way I can have multiple users logged in without interfering with each other.
